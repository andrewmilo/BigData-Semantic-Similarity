We will have 4 map/reduce phases

First we get the total number of documents: totalDocuments

Phase 1: WordCount problem
	Map: 
		Each line has a set of terms corresponding to a document id. We map this as
		(term, docID) -> 1  (term, document id pair to the count of 1)
	Reduce:
		Each (term, docID) pair will have a bunch of counts of 1 : (term, docID) -> [1,1,1,1,...,1]
		We reduce this to the sum of the values: (term, docID) -> wordCount

Phase 2: Get total word count for each document. This is the info to calculate tf
	Map: 
		We now have (term, docID) -> wordCount. 
		We map this such that we get docID -> (term, wordCount)
	Reduce:
		Each docID will now correspond to a list of words and word counts :
		docID -> [(term1, wordCount1), (term2, wordCount2), (term3, wordCount3),...,(termN, wordCountN)]
		We reduce this to the sum of the total number of wordCounts which will give us the total number of terms in a document:
		(term, docID) -> (wordCount, totalWordsInDocument)
		
Phase 3: Get the number of documents with the specific term
	Map:
		We currently have (term, docID) -> (wordCount, totalWordsInDocument)
		Map this such that word -> (docID, wordCount, totalWordsInDocument)
	Reduce:
		We would now have a document id, word count, and words in that particular document for each word:
		term -> [(docID1, wordCount1, totalWordsInDocument1), (docID2, wordCount2, totalWordsInDocument2), (docIDN, wordCountN, totalWordsInDocumentN)]
		With this, we can compute the total documents that contains the word by taking the sum of the total number of values leaving us with:
		(word, docID) -> (wordCount, totalWordsInDocument, totalDocumentsWithTerm)

Phase 4: Calculate tf-idf
	Map:
		We now have (word, docID) -> (wordCount, totalWordsInDocument, totalDocumentsWithTerm)
		So for each document we get the tf by wordCount/totalWordsinDocument.
							 we get the idf by log(totalDocuments/totalDocumentsWithTerm)
							 we multiply these two results together and get the tf-idf
		(term, docID) -> tf-idf and map it appropriately to:
		(term) -> (docID, tf-idf)
	We'll have all of these in the end for each term:
		term1 -> [(docID1, tf-idf1), (docID2, tf-idf2),...,(docIDN, tf-idfN)] Let's call this vector A
		term2 -> [(docID1, tf-idf1), (docID2, tf-idf2),...,(docIDN, tf-idfN)] Let's call this vector B
		To compute the similarity between term1 and term2 we'd do (A * B)/ (|A| * |B|)
